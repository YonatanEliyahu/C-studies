README -

the following program reads a binary matrix from a file compress the matrix as much as possible and read it back.
compressing the matrix size form (matrixSize+2)*32 bits to (matrixSize+64) bits only. // 2*32 for 2 integers that represent the rows and cols number.

for example in the given files we compress the file size from 1208 bytes to only 46 bytes !!! we used only 4% from the first size and saved the same data!
